# GODOT CARDS

This is (or will eventually be) a small suite of classic card games, implemented with the Godot engine.

I'm doing this project just to have something fun to write and work on, and to sharpen my skills with Godot.

The first game I'm planning to implement is War, since that's very simple. After that who knows?
